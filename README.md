# ðŸ‘» ghost
Ghost is a 1 day project that has the pourpose of hiding applications from screen capture. As a cronical online user, I use discord and im most of the time sharing screen. This leads to sharing some information or applications such as password-managers been leaked. This is a simple solution to that problem & a cool project to work on.
